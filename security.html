    <h1>Security</h1>

    <p>
    Cryptocurrencies allow you to <i>be your own bank</i> but <b>with this power comes responsibility</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is essential that you trust the tools that you use to manage your private keys and only run these on systems which are fully secure.
    </p>

    <p>
    For the former, Dev Null Productions has released the <a href="https://github.com/DevNullProd/flexrp">FleXRP source code</a> on github along with a detailed <a href="TODO">audit</a> of how it works, and the precautions put in place to protect you.
    </p>

    <p>
    To ensure your system is as secure as possible make sure to do the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Only run FleXRP on systems you own and only you have physical access to. Do not run this on a public machine such as one in an internet cafe or computer lab.</li>
      <li>Ensure your system is up to date and has all security updates provided by your operating system's vendor (Microsoft, Apple, Redhat, Ubuntu/Debian)</li>
      <li>Ideally this system should be dedicate to cryptocurrency key management and no unrelated software installed.</li>
      <li>Ensure that at no point this system was physically compromised. This can include the installation of keyloggers, monitoring software, or similar</li>
      <li>Only run this software in a private location and on a secure network. Do not connect to public wifi or that in a location such as an internet cafe or similar. Ensure you are not being monitored, either in person or via a surveillance system, while using this software.</li>
      <li>Optionally consider running this tool in offline mode. The can be enabled via the application 'Settings' (click the gear icon in the main window). In offline mode you will not connect to any network, though you will have to take the extra step of submitting the signed transaction at the end of the process.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    If you follow the proceedure above you can be reasonably assured that your private keys will be safe throughout the entire process!
